# Reference shots (`--shots`)

`--shots <file>` renders a list of exact camera poses, one PNG each, then exits. It exists for
visual review: take a screenshot in Skyrim, write down the camera pose, and render the same view
here, so the two images can be compared side by side and a regression shows up as a changed image
rather than a vague impression.

```
engine --assets <converted assets> --shots review/riverwood.json [--shots-out review/out]
```

Add `--hidden-window` to render and capture without displaying a game window.
The primary window starts with visibility disabled and keeps rendering in the
background; screenshots still read the same render target. This option also
works with benchmark `--acceptance-screenshot` captures. It keeps an actual
rendering window, whereas `--headless` normally removes that window. When both
are supplied, `--hidden-window` retains the hidden render target. Hidden runs
do not capture interactive mouse/controller input.

## The shots file

```json
{
  "width": 1400,
  "height": 1050,
  "shots": [
    {
      "name": "riverwood-bridge",
      "worldspace_id": 60,
      "interior_cell_id": null,
      "position": [21340.0, -44890.0, 520.0],
      "yaw": 152.7,
      "pitch": 7.9,
      "hfov": 75.0,
      "reference": "review/riverwood-bridge.jpg",
      "note": "the bridge from the south bank"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
| :-- | :-- |
| `width`, `height` | The frame size in pixels, at most 8192 each. The window is opened at this size, so the PNG is too, unless the system gives the window a different size (a screen smaller than the frame, for example); that shot's `shots.log` line then records `window=<w>x<h>`. Use the size the reference screenshots were taken at. |
| `name` | Output file stem: the image is `<out>/<name>.png`. A plain file name, unique in the file, that Windows can create (see below). |
| `worldspace_id` | The worldspace of an exterior shot (60 is Tamriel). `null` or absent leaves it to `--worldspace`. |
| `interior_cell_id` | An interior cell. Such a shot is skipped and logged: the streamer holds exterior cells only. |
| `position` | The camera's eye in Creation units, absolute (not relative to a cell or the render origin). |
| `yaw` | Skyrim heading in degrees: 0 looks north (`+Y`), 90 east (`+X`), clockwise seen from above. |
| `pitch` | Skyrim's X angle in degrees: positive looks down. |
| `hfov` | Horizontal field of view in degrees, between 0 and 180; the vertical one follows from the frame's aspect. |
| `reference`, `note` | Free text for people and comparison tools; the engine ignores them, and any other field. |

`name` has to be a file this engine can create on Windows, since it is written there: no `/`, `\`,
`:`, `<`, `>`, `"`, `|`, `?` or `*`, no control character, no trailing dot or space, and not one of the
reserved device names `CON`, `PRN`, `AUX`, `NUL`, `COM1`-`COM9` or `LPT1`-`LPT9` - with or without
an extension, and ignoring case, so `con.png` and `Nul.x` are refused too.

A file that cannot be read, is not JSON of this shape, has no shots, a zero frame, a side over 8192
pixels, a missing or non-numeric pose field, a field of view out of range, or a name that is empty,
repeated or not a name Windows can create stops the run before a window opens, with a message that
names the file and the problem.

## What a run does

Streaming starts at the first exterior shot: its worldspace (when it names one) and the grid square
its camera stands over. The run streams that one worldspace; a shot in another worldspace is
skipped and logged, like an interior shot, so a file that mixes worldspaces is rendered one
worldspace per run.

For each shot in order, the run places the camera at the pose (the streamer then loads the cells
around it) and waits until the view has settled: no cell loading, no database request in flight,
no model or surface waiting for its assets, no model waiting to be armed, no out-of-range cell
still waiting to be unloaded, no new failed cells, asset-load failures or material, terrain,
water, transform-bounds or renderer validation failures since the shot was posed, and the
renderer's final path running, for `SETTLE_QUIET_FRAMES`
(10) frames in a row, and not before `WARM_UP_SECONDS` (2 s) after start-up, while the first
pipelines compile. The frame count is exact: a view that has been quiet for ten frames running is
photographed on the tenth, and the `frames=` of its log line is then 10 - the count of quiet
frames is advanced before it is read, so it is not one more than the constant. The run then saves
the primary window to `<out>/<name>.png`. A shot that has not settled after
`SETTLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (30 s) is still captured, and the log says the timeout took it and what
was still pending or which failures prevented settling. A new failure prevents that shot from
settling even after pending work drains; its timeout capture fails the run.

`--shots-out` defaults to a `<file stem>-shots/` folder beside the shots file. `shots.log` there
has one line per shot: its name, the frames it waited, whether it settled or timed out, the image's
path, and, when the window was not the frame the file asked for, `window=<w>x<h>` - that image is
not the shape the reference is, and the engine log warns about it once. Skipped shots have a line
saying why. Each line is appended as its shot finishes, and the file is created with the first
line, so a run that is killed keeps the shots it had already taken.

The run exits with success once every shot is written, and exits non-zero - the process's exit code
is not zero, and `main` reports the failure - when an image or the log could not be written, when a
shot was given up on, when the engine exited with an error for any other reason, and when an
acceptance run's gates did not pass. `scripts/phase2-acceptance.ps1` records that exit code per
command and marks the command failed on anything but 0, so a failed shots or acceptance run is now
visible in a campaign report instead of being read as a pass.

`--headless` is ignored during a shots run, since the image is taken of the window. `--shots`
cannot be combined with a benchmark, `--acceptance-screenshot`, `--auto-fly-speed` or a fixture.
`--run-label` names the run in the window title (`Mudcrab - shots: <label>`).
